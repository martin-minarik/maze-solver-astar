# Maze solver

Maze solver in C++, using A* algorithm.

Doxygen-like documented maze.h

## Maze symbols

- **0** - empty path
- **1** - wall
- **2** - start
- **3** - goal
- **4** - path to goal (only in solved maze)

Check maze.txt and result.txt.

## Possible improvements

- Turn maze to graph and solving graph, instead of holding entire maze in memory
- Graphic representation
- Add more maze solving algorithms(BFS, DFS, ...)
